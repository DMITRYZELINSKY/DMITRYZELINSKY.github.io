		May I have your attention, please?<br>
		May I have your attention, please?<br>
		Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
		I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
		We're gonna have a problem here<br>
		
		Y'all act like you never seen a white person before<br>
		Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door<br>
		And started whoopin' her ass worse than before<br>
		They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ah)<br>
		It's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding<br>
		He didn't just say what I think he did, did he<br>
		And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots<br>
		Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (haha)<br>
		
		Feminist women love Eminem<br>
		Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him<br>
		Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what<br>
		Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though<br>
		Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<br>
		But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms<br>
		Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't<br>
		But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<br>
		
		My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips<br>
		And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss<br>
		And that's the message that we deliver to little kids<br>
		And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<br>
		Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is<br>
		By the time they hit fourth grade<br>
		They got the Discovery Channel don't they<br>
		
		We ain't nothin' but mammals<br>
		Well, some of us are cannibals<br>
		Who cut other people open like cantaloupes<br>
		But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<br>
		Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<br>
		But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote<br>
		Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes<br>
		
		I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records<br>
		Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too<br>
		You think I give a damn about a Grammy<br>
		Half of you critics can't even stomach me<br>
		Let alone stand me<br>
		But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird<br>
		Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here<br>
		So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears<br>
		Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs<br>
		So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst<br>
		And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first<br>
		Little bitch put me on blast on MTV<br>
		Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe<br>
		I should download her audio on mp3<br>
		And show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)<br>
		I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me<br>
		So I have been sent here to destroy you<br>
		And there's a million of us just like me<br>
		Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me<br>
		Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me<br>
		And just might be, the next best thing, but not quite me<br>
		'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you<br>
		Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room<br>
		The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all<br>
		And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all<br>
		I just get on the mic and spit it<br>
		And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it<br>
		Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can<br>
		Then you wonder, how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?<br>
		It's funny 'cause at the rate I'm goin' when I'm thirty<br>
		I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting<br>
		Pinchin' nurses asses while I'm jackin' off with Jergens<br>
		And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'<br>
		In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'<br>
		He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings<br>
		Or in the parkin' lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck<br>
		With his windows down and his system up<br>
		So will the real Shady, please stand up<br>
		And put one of those fingers, on each hand up<br>
		And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control<br>
		And one more time loud as you can, how does it go?<br>
		I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
		All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating<br>
		So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up<br>
		Please stand up, please stand up<br>
		Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us<br>
		Fuck it, let's all stand up.<br>
